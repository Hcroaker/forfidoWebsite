</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Site, Application and Services can be used to facilitate Bookings. Owners&rsquo; dogs that are available for walking are included in Listings on the Site, Application and Services by Owners. You may view Listings as an unregistered visitor to the Site, Application and Services; however, if you wish to make a Booking or create a Listing, you must first register to create an Forfido Account (defined below).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As stated above, Forfido makes available an online platform or marketplace with related technology for Owners and Walkers to meet online and arrange for Bookings directly with each other. Unless explicitly specified otherwise in the Forfido platform, Forfido&rsquo;s responsibilities are limited to facilitating the availability of the Site, Application and Services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLEASE NOTE THAT, AS STATED ABOVE, THE SITE, APPLICATION AND SERVICES ARE INTENDED TO BE USED TO FACILITATE WALKERS AND OWNERS CONNECTING AND BOOKING DIRECTLY WITH EACH OTHER. FORFIDO CANNOT AND DOES NOT CONTROL THE CONTENT CONTAINED IN ANY LISTINGS. FORFIDO IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY AND ALL LISTINGS AND BOOKINGS. ACCORDINGLY, ANY BOOKINGS WILL BE MADE OR ACCEPTED AT THE MEMBER&rsquo;S OWN RISK.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Account Registration</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to access certain features of the Site and Application, and to make a Booking or create a Listing, you must register to create an account (&ldquo;</span><strong>Forfido Account</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;) and become a Member. You may register to join the Services directly via the Site or Application or as described in this section.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also register to join by logging into your account with certain third-party social networking sites (&ldquo;</span><strong>SNS</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;) (including, but not limited to, Facebook; each such account, a &ldquo;</span><strong>Third-Party Account</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;), via our Site or Application, as described below. As part of the functionality of the Site, Application and Services, you may link your Forfido Account with Third-Party Accounts, by either: (i) providing your Third-Party Account login information to Forfido through the Site, Services or Application; or (ii) allowing Forfido to access your Third-Party Account, as permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third-Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account login information to Forfido and/or grant Forfido access to your Third-Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account and without obligating Forfido to pay any fees or making Forfido subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third-party service providers. By granting Forfido access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that Forfido will access, make available and store (if applicable) any Content that you have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account (&ldquo;</span><strong>SNS Content</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;) so that it is available on and through the Site, Services and Application via your Forfido Account and Forfido Account profile page. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, all SNS Content, if any, will be considered to be Member Content for all purposes of these Terms. Depending upon the Third-Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third-Party Accounts will be available on and through your Forfido Account on the Site, Services and Application. Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or Forfido&rsquo;s access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-party service provider, then SNS Content will no longer be available on and through the Site, Services and Application. You have the ability to disable the connection between your Forfido Account and your Third-Party Accounts, at any time, by accessing the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; section of the Site and Application. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. Forfido makes no effort to review any SNS Content for any purpose, including but not limited to for accuracy, legality or non-infringement and Forfido is not responsible for any SNS Content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Forfido Account and your Forfido Account profile page will be created for your use of the Site and Application based upon the personal information you provide to us or that we obtain via an SNS as described above. You may not have more than one (1) active Forfido Account. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. Forfido reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Forfido Account and your access to the Site, Application and Services if you create more than one (1) Forfido Account, or if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, fraudulent, not current, incomplete, or otherwise in violation of these Terms and Conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You agree that you will not disclose your password to any third party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless expressly authorised by a specific feature on Forfido, you are not permitted to share your Forfido Account with anyone or allow others to access or use your Forfido Account. Forfido may enable features, in our discretion, that allow other Members to take certain actions associated with your Forfido Account, on your behalf with your express authorisation, such as having a family member or agent make a Booking on your behalf or adding a family member to your account as an additional Walker. You agree that you will take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your Forfido Account, whether or not you have authorised such activities or actions. You will immediately notify Forfido of any unauthorised use of your Forfido Account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Listings</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Member, you may create Listings. To create a Listing, you will be asked a variety of questions about the dog to be listed, including, but not limited to, the location, gender, size, personality, heath condition and age of the dog. In order to be featured in Listings via the Site, Application and Services, you understand and agree that the placement or ranking of Listings in search results may depend upon a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, Owner and Walker preferences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Members will be able to make Bookings via the Site, Application and Services based upon the information provided in your Listing, your Owner requirements, and Owners&rsquo; search parameters and preferences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You acknowledge and agree that you alone are responsible for any and all Listings and Member Content you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and any Booking you post (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws, Intellectual Property laws, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Booking (including having all required permits, licences and registrations), and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that Forfido assumes no responsibility for a Walker&rsquo;s compliance with any agreements with or duties to third parties, applicable laws, rules and regulations. Forfido reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that Forfido, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or Forfido&rsquo;s then-current&nbsp;policies or otherwise harmful to the Site, Application or Services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are an Owner, you understand and agree that Forfido does not act as an insurer or as your contracting agent. If a Walker requests a Booking, any agreement you enter into with such Owner is between you and the Owner and Forfido is not a party to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you create a Listing, you may also choose to include certain requirements which must be met by the Members who are eligible to request a Booking, such as requiring Members to have a profile picture or verified phone number, in order to make a Booking. Any Member wishing to make a Booking of a dog included in Listings with such requirements must meet these requirements. More information on how to set such requirements is available via the &ldquo;Walking&rdquo; section of the Site, Application and Services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are an Owner, Forfido makes certain tools available to you to help you to make informed decisions about which Members you choose to confirm or preapprove for Bookings. You acknowledge and agree that, as an Owner, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and in relation to Forfido you are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who make Bookings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>No Endorsement</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forfido does not endorse any Member or Listing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members are required by these Terms to provide accurate information. Although Forfido may, for transparency or fraud prevention or detection purposes, directly or through third parties, ask you to provide a form of government identification, your date of birth, and other information, or undertake additional checks and processes designed to help verify or check the identities or backgrounds of Members and/or screen Member information against third party databases or other sources, we do not make any representations about, confirm, or endorse any Member or the Member&rsquo;s purported identity or background.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By registering for a Forfido Account, you agree that Forfido may - but is not obligated to - request a consumer report on you from a Consumer Reporting Agency. If we do request a consumer report, we&rsquo;ll request and use it in compliance with applicable law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any references in the Site, Application or Services to a Member being &ldquo;verified&rdquo; or &ldquo;connected&rdquo; (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification or identification process, and does not represent anything else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Forfido about any Member, including of the Member&rsquo;s identity and whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. Instead, any such description is intended to be useful information for you to evaluate when you make your own decisions about the identity and suitability of others whom you contact or interact with via the Site, Application and Services. We therefore recommend that you always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to make or accept a Booking request or to have any other interaction with any other Member. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using the Site, Application or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm. You agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any legal remedy from Forfido with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Members on the Site and Services regarding any Bookings or Listings made by you. </span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bookings and Financial Terms for Owners</span></em></li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are an Owner and a Booking is requested for your dog via the Site, Application or Services, you will be required to either preapprove, confirm or reject the Booking request within the Booking Request Period, otherwise the Booking request will automatically expire. When a Booking is requested via the Site, Application or Services, we will share with you (i) the first and last name of the Walker who has requested the Booking, (ii) a link to the Walker&rsquo;s Forfido Account profile page, (iii) if the Owner and Walker have both connected their Forfido accounts to SNS and have not turned off sharing of social connections, the names of any shared connections on such SNS, and (iv) an indication of whether or not the Walker has provided other information to Forfido, such as a verified email address, connection to SNSs, or a government ID. When you confirm a Booking requested by a Walker, Forfido will send you a Communication confirming such Booking, depending upon the selections you make via the Site, Application and Services and will automatically collect the Booking Donation via the Payment Method. Unless the relevant Booking is cancelled as set out below, Forfido will forward the Booking Donation, less the Forfido Fee, the designated charity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each Owner agrees that Forfido may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Owner and reflected in the relevant Listing, (i) permit the Walker to cancel the Booking and (ii) refund to the Owner the relevant Booking Donation.</span></p>

<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bookings Terms for Walkers</span></em></li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Walkers, not Forfido, are solely responsible for honouring any confirmed Bookings. If you, as a Walker, choose to make a Booking of an Accommodation, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Owner and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Walk imposed by the Owner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Forfido, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that Forfido is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of Forfido&rsquo;s payment obligations pursuant to the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/terms/payments_terms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clause</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 10, Forfido (inclusive of all subsidiaries) disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your Booking is cofirmed you will receive a confirmation Communication summarising your confirmed Booking.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></li>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Service Fees and Other Fees</span></em></li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In consideration for the use of Forfido&rsquo;s online marketplace and platform, Forfido charges the Forfido Fees. Forfido collects these fees pursuant to the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/terms/payments_terms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">terms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and conditions hereof, and, where applicable, may also collect taxes (such as GST in Australia) in respect of the Booking Donations. Forfido deducts the Forfido Fees from the Booking Donations before remitting the balance to the Owner&rsquo;s designated charity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applicable Booking Donations, as well as taxes collected by Forfido, will be shown to Owners via the Site and Application at checkout, prior to their acceptance of a Booking request. </span></p>

</ol>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cancellations and Refunds</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If, as an Owner, you wish to cancel a confirmed Booking made via the Site, Application and Services, prior to the agreed time for the Walk, the cancellation policy of the Walker contained in the applicable Listing will apply to such cancellation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a Walker cancels a confirmed Booking made via the Site, Services, and Application, (i) Forfido will refund the Booking Donation for such Booking to the applicable Owner&nbsp;and (ii) the Owner will receive a Communication from Forfido containing alternative Listings and other related information. If the Owner requests a Booking from one of the alternative Listings and the Walker associated with such alternative Listing confirms the Owner&rsquo;s requested Booking, then the Owner agrees to pay Forfido the Booking Donation relating to the confirmed Booking for the Walk in the alternative Listing, in accordance with these Terms. If a Walker cancelled a confirmed Booking and you, as an Owner, have not received a Communication from Forfido, please&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/help/contact_us"><span style="font-weight: 400;">contact Forfido</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If, as a Walker, you cancel a confirmed Booking, you agree that Forfido may apply penalties or consequences to you or your Listing, including (i) publishing an automated review on your Listing indicating that a Booking was cancelled, and (ii) keeping the calendar for your Listing unavailable or blocked for the dates of the cancelled Booking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In certain circumstances, Forfido may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary or desirable to cancel a confirmed Booking made via the Site, Application and Services. You agree that Forfido and the relevant Owner or Walker will not have any liability for such cancellations or refunds.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resolution Centre</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owners may use the Resolution Centre to send or request money for refunds, services or damages related to their Bookings. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donations</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Owner and Walkers may pledge to donate additional funds to a particular cause or charity. We do not take any responsibility or liability for whether the Owner or Walker does in fact make the donation he or she pledged to make. In such cases, the Owner or Walker in question is responsible for his or her own compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to such pledges and/or fund-raising.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Booking Modifications</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You as an Owner or Walker are responsible for any modifications to a Booking that you direct Forfido Customer Service to make (&ldquo;</span><strong>Booking Modifications</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;), and you agree to pay any relevant service fees associated with such Booking Modifications.</span></p>

<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Dangerous dogs</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an Owner, you are responsible for ensuring that you do not list for Bookings any dog that is known to be dangerous or vicious or to have an aggressive temperament that is reasonably likely to place its Walker or others in danger of attack or associated injury. &nbsp;You are also responsible for including in your Listing all information about your dog that a Walker may reasonably expect in order to make a Booking for a Walk of that dog.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forfido will in any event not be responsible for any injury or death or loss or damage occasioned in the conduct of a Walk, and each of the Owner and the Walker agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Forfido in relation to any injury or death or loss or damage occasioned in the conduct of a Walk.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Removing or keeping dog without the Owner&rsquo;s Consent</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walkers agree that a confirmed Booking is merely a licence granted by the Owner to the Walker to take control of the dog for the limited duration of the confirmed Booking and in accordance with the Owner&rsquo;s agreement with the Walker about each Walk. Walkers further agree to return the dog no later than the return time that the Owner specifies in the Listing or such other time as mutually agreed upon between the Walker and Owner. </span></p>

<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These Terms and your use of the Services will be interpreted in accordance with the laws applicable in the State of Queensland, Australia, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a court located in Brisbane, Queensland for any actions for which the parties&nbsp;</span><strong>retain the right to seek</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&rsquo;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights,&nbsp;</span><strong>as set forth in the Dispute Resolution provision below.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you reside in the United States, you and Forfido agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site, Application or Collective Content (collectively, &ldquo;</span><strong>Disputes</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&rsquo;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Forfido are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Forfido otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&rsquo;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section will survive any termination of these Terms.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This agreement to arbitrate evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;</span><strong>AAA</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;) in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the &ldquo;</span><strong>AAA Rules</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;) then in effect, except as modified by this &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section. (The AAA Rules are available at&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.adr.org/arb_med</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">or by calling the AAA at 1&ndash;800&ndash;778&ndash;7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arbitration Process</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dDocName=ADRSTAGE2034889&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased"><span style="font-weight: 400;">form Demand for Arbitration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA&rsquo;s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arbitration Location and Procedure</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Unless you and Forfido otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed&nbsp;$10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Forfido submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds&nbsp;$10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arbitrator&rsquo;s Decision</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator&rsquo;s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator&rsquo;s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the &ldquo;Limitation of Liability&rdquo; section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favour of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant&rsquo;s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Forfido will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fees</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed&nbsp;$75,000, Forfido will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changes</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Notwithstanding the provisions of the &ldquo;Modification&rdquo; section above, if Forfido changes this &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section after the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the &ldquo;Last Updated&rdquo; date above or in the date of Forfido&rsquo;s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Forfido in accordance with the provisions of this &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section as of the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</span></p>

<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>General</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The failure of Forfido to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorised representative of Forfido. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</span></p>
